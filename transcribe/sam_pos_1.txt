Samsung customer service rocks!
My 2 year old Samsung smart TV stopped showing over the air broadcast channels today. I messed with it several times but couldn't get it to auto program. I found a Samsung customer service phone number in the on screen help menu and called at 10 pm on a Friday night AND THEY ANSWERED!!!! I couldn't believe it. A very helpful and knowledgeable lady ask a couple of questions then guided me through the reset process and waited while it auto programmed. It worked! Holy crap, good customer service. I'm not loyal to any brand of products, I usually base my purchase decisions on price but after this experience Samsung will be my go to brand.
Thank you Samsung,

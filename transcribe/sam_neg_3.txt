Samsung Website could not find my order to provide order status for 4 days after I ordered a 2TB V-Nand SSD 970 EVO NVMe M.2 so I attempted for 2 days to cancel the order only to blocked by Samsung insisting that I could do that myself on Samsung's website. When I insisted the order be canceled, Samsung refused to cancel the order several times. Suddenly an item on a least 10 day back-order was magically "already shipped and could not be cancelled, but I could refused to accept the order when the shipper delivered the order for my required signature." Except USPS just dropped the package in my mailbox as no signature was required. It is plain that Samsung only goal was to book the sale and not customer support. Image the nightmare trying to get tech support for such an item. Why am I on this page? I'm trying to find return information as I no longer want or need this V-Nand SSD 970 EVO NVMe M.2 as HP sells a better 2TB SSD NVMe M.2 for $200 US dollars less. (See Tom's Hardware review dated 26 Feb 2019). Also I get suggest that Samsung talk to Kim Jong-un about hiring some proven skilled programmers as Samsung Website is proof that Samsung does not have any.

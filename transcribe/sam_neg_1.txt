The amount of time and energy that I have spent to try to get this issue resolved is absurd. We purchased these headphones in January. The 1st set stopped working and we returned to the ATT store. The replacement set also stopped working in March. We started refund process and mailed the headphones in back in April. IT IS NOW ALMOST SEPTEMBER AND I STILL HAVE NO REFUND. Every time I call they promise it's coming. Or there's missing information to complete the refund. And someone will call me in 2 days...but they never do. I will NEVER purchase a Samsung product again. This experience has horrible.

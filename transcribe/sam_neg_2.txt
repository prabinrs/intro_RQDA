Hello,
As of today (August 15, 2019), I have not received my refund. It has been since February 2019, and I do not have my refund in the approximate amount of $1,200. In December 2018, I purchased a new refrigerator from Samsung. The refrigerator would not go into defrost. After repeated attempts to get a repair/ maintenance company, I failed. In February 2019, Samsung made an assurance that I would receive a refund in full because it was a faulty unit. I was told to attach the S/N to the Acceptance Letter along with a copy of my cash paid in full receipt. I was told to disconnect the refrigerator and CUT the cord. Along with these actions, I had to send a picture of the severed cord and the removed S/N. I counted 30 emails which I have sent to Samsung with promises to refund my money. As of May, I have spoken with 10 agents. Please do not purchase any Samsung products.

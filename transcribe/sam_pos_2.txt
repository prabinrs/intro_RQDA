Had an issue with a front loading washing machine. We live 6 hours from the nearest capital city and 22 hours from the nearest Samsung office. Rang samsung and got the standard call centre......at this point it looked like the standard outcome would apply....."we will send a tech out". "Not to where we are!!". Job number logged and I am 24 hours from making the decision to buy a new washing machine and taking the long and boring 6 hour drive to a shop that sells washing machines. Got a callback from the local Samsung rep/tech 15 hours later and worked through the issue over 4 phone calls and they are posting the repair part out in 24 hours at no cost. This is the greatest customer service I have ever had. I am a elec tech by trade but this means nothing without the manual. The local rep actually talked through the in-house manual and we sorted the problem. Greatest customer service ever

I am 74 years old, and had an experience that I wanted to share with you. I live in a retirement community in So.California.We have an indoor pool that I frequent often. This last week I went for a swim, and worked out for about 30 minutes doing laps. At the end I decided to jump in the Jacuzzi and relax. I stayed about 20 minutes .As I was leaving I felt something in my pocket that was not my keys, but my Samsung S5 cell phone. I jumped out and immediately took it out and to my surprise it was working, not flooded with water. I guess old age gets us all eventually, but for me at my age buying a new phone is not going to happen. I appreciate the quality and workmanship that goes into your product. Companies that offer a great product need to have positive responce when it is due. Thanks again Gary
